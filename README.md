# SkillBoost — Build Better Habits

![SkillBoost Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oNfCrBP.png)

It starts with a simple truth: we want better habits, but real life keeps interrupting. Lists help for a week, then fade.

**SkillBoost** was built to change that. Developed with a **vanilla stack** — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, Node.js powering the backend calls to **Google’s Gemini AI** — it learns how you live and adapts to you. Gemini shapes routines that fit your goals, analyzes your progress, and even turns your plan into custom motivational podcasts you can take on the go.

Open-source, distraction-free, and focused on what matters: steady progress, one habit at a time.
