![SkillBoost Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oNfCrBP.png)

SkillBoost is a completely open-source project dedicated to helping people improve their habits through a modern, easy-to-use platform. It features templates for morning routines, healthy habits, physical well-being, and time management, all powered by **Gemini from Google** to provide personalized recommendations and insights. The goal is to make habit formation simpler and more accessible to everyone.

This project was built using a **stock vanilla stack** — **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — without frameworks, focusing on clean, lightweight, and maintainable code.  
It was developed as part of the **TripleTen Software Engineering Code Jam – August Edition**.
