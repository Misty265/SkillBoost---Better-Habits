# SkillBoost — Build Better Habits

![SkillBoost Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oNfCrBP.png)

It starts with a simple truth: we want better habits, but real life keeps interrupting. Lists help for a week, then fade.

**SkillBoost** was built to change that. Developed with a **vanilla stack** — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, Node.js powering the backend calls to **Google’s Gemini AI** — it learns how you live and adapts to you. Gemini shapes routines that fit your goals.

Open-source, distraction-free, and focused on what matters: steady progress, one habit at a time.
