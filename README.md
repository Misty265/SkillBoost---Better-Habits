# SkillBoost — Better Habits

![SkillBoost Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oNfCrBP.png)

SkillBoost is a completely open-source project dedicated to helping people improve their habits through a modern, easy-to-use platform. It features templates for morning routines, healthy habits, physical well-being, and time management, all powered by **Gemini from Google** to provide personalized recommendations and insights. The goal is to make habit formation simpler and more accessible to everyone.

This project was built using a **stock vanilla stack** — **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — without frameworks, focusing on clean, lightweight, and maintainable code.  
It was developed as part of the **TripleTen Software Engineering Code Jam – August Edition**.

# SkillBoost — Build Better Habits

It starts with a simple truth: we want better habits, but real life keeps interrupting. Lists help for a week, then fade.

**[SkillBoost](https://seroujk.github.io/SkillBoost---Better-Habits/)** was built to change that. Developed with a **vanilla stack** — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, Node.js powering the backend calls to **Google’s Gemini AI** — it learns how you live and adapts to you. Gemini shapes routines that fit your goals.

Open-source, distraction-free, and focused on what matters: steady progress, one habit at a time.
